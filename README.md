# Caz's Final Portfolio

I created my site using a mock-up made on Adobe XD. I created a low fidelity prototype using my past knowledge in User Experience Design. The hardest challenge I faced was converting the mock-up to a full high fidelity creation in VSC. Getting the spacing and all other formatting correct was challenging because there was a lot of image resizing needed and alternative solutions to create this site. By coming up with similar but different solutions, I was able to overcome these changes and challenges.

I learned a lot about using grids and flex boxes to properly format sections. As well as creating interative images.
